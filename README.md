# BMARBLE (WIP) 


### Block Matching Anaglyphical Reversion Based on Laplacian of  gaussian Encoding

BMARBLE is a computationally efficient algorithm for anaglyphical reversion, designed by Felipe Carneiro Machado, under Prof. Dr. Rudinei Goularte as a scientific initiation project at SÃ£o Paulo University. This repository contains a non-optimized Python implementation of said algorithm as described in the (as of now only submitted) associated article. 

## Disclaimer

This code is not the same one used to generate the results for the article, slight alterations have been made between the test versions and
 this final one. Results may differ slightly, for better or worse.

Also, as of this version, the code was not yet tested and validated against the original version

## Installation

This code was built with Python 3.12, so this is the recommended version. To download dependencies, create a Python virtual environment (venv) with:

```
python3 -m venv .
```

And download dependencies with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
